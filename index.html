        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p class="normal-text">
          Undergraduate student at University of California, Santa Barbara soon to graduate with a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences (i.e. Applied Mathematics). Interested in data science, machine learning, predictive modeling, databasing, web-scraping, and web-development. Looking for a fast-paced environment with a lot of challenges that need creative and technical solutions. My ambition is to obtain a wide variety of skills so I can take on multiple roles at a small, but quickly growing company. 
        </p>
        <h2>PERSONAL PROJECTS</h2>
        <p class="normal-text">
          I have worked on a large variety of self-started projects ranging from web-scraping to predictive modeling. For one, I've created a variety of Twitter bots using the Twitter REST API, many of which utilize powerful machine learning techniques such as sentiment analysis (NLPK), markov chains, personality insights <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/?S_PKG=&cm_mmc=Search_Google-_-Cloud_Bluemix+Program-_-WW_US-_-ibm+bluemix_Exact_&cm_mmca1=000002FP&cm_mmca2=10001882&mkwid=01d23154-8501-4244-b28c-f9236fd38b00|401|1650992&cvosrc=ppc.google.ibm%20bluemix&cvo_campaign=Cloud_Bluemix%20Program-WW_US&cvo_crid=191089144216&Matchtype=e" id="bluemix">(IBM Bluemix)</a>, and more. For some of these Twitter bots, I've implemented MySQL databases from which my scripts retrieve information vital to the bots' functions. These scripts also automatically update their databases on their own. In addition to these projects utilizing the Twitter API, I've done some projects in web-scraping. Using Python's urllib and beautiful soup libraries, I've built a web-crawler that hops from site to site gathering and storing email addresses. This web-crawler also utilizes a local MySQL database. Of course, in addition to all of these projects, I also wrote from scratch (HTML & CSS) the very webpage you are currently viewing!
