      		<h2>PERSONAL PROJECTS</h2>
      		<p>
      			I have worked on a large variety of self-started projects. The personal projects that have captivated me the most are those that have used the Twitter API. I've created a variety of Twitter bots, many of which utilize powerful machine learning techniques such as sentiment analysis (NLPK), markov chains, personality insights <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/?S_PKG=&cm_mmc=Search_Google-_-Cloud_Bluemix+Program-_-WW_US-_-ibm+bluemix_Exact_&cm_mmca1=000002FP&cm_mmca2=10001882&mkwid=01d23154-8501-4244-b28c-f9236fd38b00|401|1650992&cvosrc=ppc.google.ibm%20bluemix&cvo_campaign=Cloud_Bluemix%20Program-WW_US&cvo_crid=191089144216&Matchtype=e">(IBM Bluemix)</a>, and more. For one of these Twitter bots, I implemented a MySQL database from which my script retrieves information vital to the bot's function and into which my script stores the new, vital information. In addition to these projects utilizing the Twitter API, I have done a lot of work with web-scraping.
