      Hi! Welcome to my website.<br/><br/>My name is Travis Cramer. I'm a 21 year-old undergraduate student at UC Santa Barbara currently working towards a B.S. in Applied Math with a minor in English. In my classes, in my free time, and through the time I spend in the Data Science Club at UCSB, I'm also pursuing skills in software development.

  <div class="main-box" id="third-box">
      <p class="main-text">
        I'm interested in data science, machine learning, databasing, web-scraping, and web-development. Looking for a fast-paced environment with a lot of challenges that need creative and technical solutions. My ambition is to obtain a wide variety of skills so I can take on multiple roles at a small, but quickly growing company. Currently seeking opportunities that would begin employment in the Fall of 2017.

      <h3>Data Science at UCSB</h3>
      <p class="main-text">
        For over a year now, I have participated in the Data Science club at UCSB by taking part in the Project Group where I engaged in predictive modeling competitions held by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions" class="text-link" target="_blank">kaggle.com</a>. There, I've worked with others in teams of 3-4 to create predictive models by using powerful machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and more.

  <div class="main-box" id="fifth-box">
    <h3>Web-scraping</h3>
      <p class="main-text">
        Using Python's urllib and beautiful soup libraries, I have written several web-crawlers that hop from site to site scraping and storing email addresses, tables, pieces of text, and/or datasets. For each of these crawlers, I've implemented a MySQL database into which the script stores all of the data in a structured form.
      </p>
  </div>


  <div class="main-box" id="sixth-box">
    <h3>Twitter</h3>
      <p class="main-text">
        I've created a variety of Twitter bots (such as <a href="https://twitter.com/get_analyzed" class="text-link" target="_blank">@get_analyzed</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/get_mimicked" class="text-link" target="_blank">@get_mimicked</a>) using the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public" class="text-link" target="_blank">Twitter REST API</a>, many of which utilize machine learning techniques such as sentiment analysis, markov chains, personality insights <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/?S_PKG=&cm_mmc=Search_Google-_-Cloud_Bluemix+Program-_-WW_US-_-ibm+bluemix_Exact_&cm_mmca1=000002FP&cm_mmca2=10001882&mkwid=01d23154-8501-4244-b28c-f9236fd38b00|401|1650992&cvosrc=ppc.google.ibm%20bluemix&cvo_campaign=Cloud_Bluemix%20Program-WW_US&cvo_crid=191089144216&Matchtype=e" class="text-link" target="_blank">(IBM Bluemix)</a>, and more. For most of these Twitter bots, I've also implemented MySQL databases from which the scripts retrieve information vital to the bots' functions. These scripts also update their respective databases as more data needs to be stored.
